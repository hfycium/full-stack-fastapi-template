## Technology Stack and Features

- ⚡ [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) for the Python backend API.
  - 🧰 [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com) for the Python SQL database interactions (ORM).
  - 🔍 [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev), used by FastAPI, for the data validation and settings management.
  - 💾 [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as the SQL database.
- 🚀 [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend.
  - 🧩 Built into the backend application and served by FastAPI on the same domain as the API.
  - 💃 Using TypeScript, hooks, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), and other parts of a modern frontend stack.
  - 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for the frontend components.
  - 🤖 An automatically generated frontend client.
  - 🧪 [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for end-to-end testing.
  - 🦇 Dark mode support.
- ☁️ [FastAPI Cloud](https://fastapicloud.com) for deployment.
- 🐋 [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com) for local services and self-hosted deployment.
  - 📞 [Traefik](https://traefik.io) as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS.
- 🔒 Secure password hashing by default.
- 🔑 JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
- 📫 Email-based password recovery.
- ✉️ [React Email](https://react.email) for email templates.
- 📬 [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org) for local email testing during development.
- ✅ Tests with [Pytest](https://pytest.org).
- 🏭 CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous deployment) based on GitHub Actions.

### Experimental RegScope PR Test Selection

The optional `RegScope PR Selection` workflow builds a baseline test-to-function
mapping on pushes to `master`, then runs change-selected backend tests on pull
requests. The existing `Test Backend` full-suite workflow remains enabled and
authoritative; a missing baseline mapping causes the RegScope job to skip. The
selection workflow is an additional signal and does not claim CI time savings.

To enable it, define these repository Actions variables and point them at a
published, publicly readable RegScope revision. A tag or commit SHA makes the
tool version reproducible; a branch name follows that branch's latest revision:

- `REGSCOPE_REPOSITORY`: repository in `owner/name` form.
- `REGSCOPE_REF`: branch, tag, or commit containing the mapping and provenance
  CLI support.

Mappings are reused only for the exact pull-request base commit and matching
Python/dependency configuration. RegScope's provenance checks fall back to all
discovered tests if the mapping no longer matches the checkout. If either
repository variable is missing, the optional selection jobs are skipped; the
full backend test workflow still runs.
